## INTENT AND USE

The computer program described in this guide constitutes a prototype
model for simulating the evolution in microstructure, solution composition,
and phase abundance and composition of portland cement-based concrete binders
during their hydration or subsequent deterioratation by groundwater leaching
or external sulfate attack. It has been developed from the best knowledge and
understanding currently available, but has some limitations that must be
understood and considered by the user. This software is intended for use by persons
competent in the science of cement-based materials and having some familiarity
with computers.
