- Operations Panel
	- Pause button seems to not work
	- Set Priority button seems to not work
	- Jobs and their results are both appearing in the Operations Panel. The jobs (starting with genmic_ and HydrationSim_) should be true Operations, but the result of the job (ending with Microstructure or starting with Hydration_) should probably separated into a Results panel with all the functionality that they now have in the Operations Panel (View 3D Results and Plot Data)

- Files Panel should open up on a view of the Operations Folder by default

- Home Page
	- Explain the three icons in the lower right corner
	- Make all the current icons and text a bit bigger in the main view
	- Incorporate a VCCTL icon on the main page and the About VCCTL dialog. The icon file is ./icons/vcctl-icon-maroon.png
