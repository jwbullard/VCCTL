### **Technical Implementation Details:**

#### **Hydration Panel Changes:**
**File**: `src/app/windows/panels/hydration_panel.py`
- **Lines 1693-1697**: Clean naming validation requiring user-defined operation names
- **Lines 1699-1707**: Complete UI parameter capture and database operation creation with lineage
- **Lines 3260-3356**: Three new methods implementing Phase 3 functionality:
  - `_capture_hydration_ui_parameters()`: Captures all UI state including temperature profiles
  - `_find_microstructure_operation_id()`: Locates parent microstructure operation by name
  - `_create_hydration_operation()`: Creates database operation with lineage and parameters

#### **Database Operation Creation:**
```python
# Phase 3 creates operations with complete lineage:
operation = Operation(
    name=operation_name,  # Clean user-defined name
    operation_type=OperationType.HYDRATION.value,
    status=OperationStatus.QUEUED.value,
    stored_ui_parameters=ui_parameters,  # Complete UI state
    parent_operation_id=parent_operation_id  # Lineage to microstructure
)
```

#### **UI Parameter Capture Examples:**
```python
# Complete hydration parameter capture includes:
ui_params = {
    'operation_name': 'UserDefinedName',
    'source_microstructure': {'name': 'ParentMicrostructure', 'path': './Operations/...'},
    'curing_conditions': {'thermal_mode': 'isothermal', 'temperature': 25.0},
    'advanced_settings': {'c3a_fraction': 0.08, 'ettringite_formation': True},
    'temperature_profile': {'name': 'Custom', 'points': [{'time': 0, 'temp': 25.0}]},
    'database_modifications': {'cement_dissolution_rate': 1.2}
}
```

- **Solution**: Updated models and Pydantic schemas to use consistent `specific_surface_area` naming
- **Result**: All materials now use standardized surface area field naming

#### **2. Materials Loading Recovery ✅**  
- **Filler Materials**: Fixed `blaine_fineness` → `specific_surface_area` (model + schemas)
- **Silica Fume Materials**: Fixed `surface_area` → `specific_surface_area` (model + schemas)
- **Database Verification**: Confirmed all field queries work correctly
- **Material Counts**: Restored access to 4 filler + 3 silica fume materials

#### **3. Systematic PSD Renormalization Plan ✅**
**Problem Statement**: Each material model has embedded PSD columns creating inconsistent PSD functionality across materials.

**Goal**: All materials use exactly the same PSD functionality through unified PSD architecture.
